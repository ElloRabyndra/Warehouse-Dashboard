# My React Starter Template

This repository provides a personal React.js starter template that I use for my projects. My goal is to continuously develop and update this template to align with my evolving skills and project needs in React. This template is open for public use, so feel free to leverage it if you want to kickstart your React development without the hassle of setting up and configuring dependencies from scratch. Suggestions for further development are always welcome!

## Features & What's Included

This template comes packed with essential features, libraries, and a well-organized folder structure to get you up and running quickly:

### Key Libraries & Technologies

The template is built with a several stack, including:

* **React**
* **Vite**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **Shadcn UI**
* **React Hook Form**
* **Zod**
* **React Router**
* **Axios**
* **React Toastify**

### Core Files & Folder Structure

The project is organized into a clear and maintainable structure:

* **`public/`**: Static assets.
* **`src/`**: Application source code.
    * **`assets/`**: Images and static files.
    * **`components/`**: Reusable UI components.
        * **`common/`**: General-purpose components (e.g., `ToastWrapper.jsx`).
        * **`ui/`**: Styled UI components (e.g., `Button.jsx`, `Input.jsx`, `Switch.jsx`, `Card.jsx`, `Label.jsx`, `ToggleTheme.jsx`).
    * **`context/`**: Global state management (e.g., `ThemeContext.jsx` for dark/light mode).
    * **`features/`**: Feature-specific modules (e.g., `auth/` for authentication logic, schemas, and protected routes).
    * **`lib/`**: Utility functions (e.g., `utils.js` for `cn` function).
    * **`pages/`**: Top-level application pages (e.g., `Home.jsx`).
    * **`routing/`**: Centralized routing configuration (`Routing.jsx`).
    * **`style/`**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS imports (`Style.css`).
* **`index.html`**: Main HTML file.
* **`vite.config.js`**: Vite configuration, including path aliases for `@/src`.
* **`jsconfig.json`**: JavaScript project configuration, defining path aliases.
* **`package.json`**: Project metadata and script commands.
* **`package-lock.json`**: Records the exact dependency tree.
* **`eslint.config.js`**: ESLint configuration for code linting.

### Theming

* **Dark/Light Mode**: The template includes a basic theme toggling functionality using `ThemeContext` and a `ToggleTheme` component, demonstrating how to implement theming in a React application with Tailwind CSS, leveraging CSS variables for dynamic styling.

### Authentication

This template provides a **simple authentication** system, ideal for understanding basic authentication flows in React.

* **`useAuth` Hook**: A custom React Hook for managing user authentication state, including registration, login, logout, email validation, and profile updates.
* **`ProtectedRoute` & `AuthRedirect`**: Components to control access to routes based on authentication status, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain pages and redirecting logged-in users from authentication pages.
* **Zod Schemas**: Robust validation schemas (`registerSchema`, `loginSchema`, `profileSchema`) for handling user input during authentication flows.

**Please Note**: This authentication implementation is designed for simplicity and demonstration purposes. It does **not** include robust security features such as password hashing, encryption, secure token management (e.g., JWTs with refresh tokens), or advanced protection against common web vulnerabilities. For production applications, it is highly recommended to integrate with a secure backend authentication service and implement industry-standard security practices. This section can be further developed to incorporate more advanced security measures.

## Getting Started

There are two primary ways to get started with this React starter template:

1.  **Using GitHub's "Use this template" feature (Recommended)**:
    This is the easiest way to create a new repository from this template.
    * Navigate to the repository page on GitHub.
    * Click the green **"Use this template"** button (usually located near the top right, above the file list).
    * Select **"Create a new repository"** to generate a new project based on this template under your GitHub account.
    * Once your new repository is created, **clone your *new* repository** to your local machine:
        ```bash
        git clone <YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY_URL>
        cd <YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY_NAME>
        ```

2.  **Manually cloning the template (Alternative)**:
    If you prefer to start by cloning the template directly, you can do so, but remember you'll need to initialize your own Git repository afterward.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ellorabyndra/myreacttemplate.git](https://github.com/ellorabyndra/myreacttemplate.git)
    cd myreacttemplate
    # Initialize your own Git repository (optional, but recommended for your project)
    # git remote remove origin
    # git init
    # git add .
    # git commit -m "Initial commit from template"
    # git branch -M main
    # git remote add origin <YOUR_NEW_REMOTE_REPOSITORY_URL>
    # git push -u origin main
    ```

---

Once you have the template on your local machine, follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```
    Using pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    # or pnpm dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your application in the browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Build for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or yarn build
    # or pnpm build
    ```
    This command will bundle your application for production, optimizing it for deployment.

4.  **Preview the production build**:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    # or yarn preview
    # or pnpm preview
    ```
    This command will serve the production build locally for testing.
